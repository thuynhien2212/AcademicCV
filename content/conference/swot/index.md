abstract: "**INTRODUCTION**: Given the undeniably important role of health technology assessment (HTA) in low- and middle-income countries, the Vietnamese government has made significant progress in applying this tool to decision-making for a sustainable healthcare system. However, Vietnam is in the preliminary stage of HTA due to insufficient HTA governance, resources, and awareness.<br>
**OBJECTIVES**
This study aims to identify promising strategies for effectively implementing HTA in Vietnam using a combined Delphi-SWOT approach.<br> 
**METHODS**
WA Delphi consensus study with three rounds of semi-structured interviews has been implemented to gather opinions from all relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and researchers. Firstly, a systematic review (SR) was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and grey literature until December 2023 to identify indicators of barriers and facilitators for implementing HTA. The results obtained from SR were delivered to the first round to formulate a SWOT framework. The second round is to develop a ranking system for each factor in the S, W, O, and T domains, followed.<br>
**RESULTS**
After the first round, 81 initial indicators extracted from SR results were reduced to 45 and classified into the SWOT categories (S-11, W-7, O-18, T-9). Fifty experts have participated in the second round, and we expect to complete the remaining two Delphi rounds by 05/2024. Expected results include the consent SWOT framework and best-ranked strategies for facilitating HTA implementation.<br>
**CONCLUSION**
Findings from the study will provide an overview of the current situation related to HTA implementation based on multidisciplinary perspectives. The potential strategic recommendations associated with SWOT analysis could equip policymakers with evidence to develop a detailed action plan for HTA implementation and roadmap in Vietnam."
