abstract: "Nowadays, the growing prevalence of chronic diseases pose significant challenges to health system sustainability in low-middle income countries (LMIC). These systems with finite resources have historically been developed to address infectious diseases and are currently ill-equipped to carry the financial implications of chronic disease management, such as providing innovative and long-term treatments for facilitating effective caring in patients with chronic conditions. Therefore, systematic estimation of the burden of chronic disease is pivotal for policymakers and other stakeholders to formulate healthcare policies and to allocate efficient resources. Some previous studies have analyzed the disease and economic burden of chronic diseases by related indicators, but these indicators have not been systematically synthesized and classified by purposes and settings for resource savings. The objective of this study is to systematically review the disease and economic burden of some chronic diseases in LMIC  and to develop a proposed set of assessment criteria of indicators measuring these burdens according to purposes of usage and different settings."
